## 📖 About the Project

**Marome Investments** is a professional, responsive business website built for a backend services and client coaching startup business.  
The platform showcases the company’s services, background, and contact details, while also allowing clients to submit **project inquiries** through a secure backend system.

> Note:  
> The Vercel deployment is a **frontend-only demo version**.  
> Client inquiry requests are functional only on the official live domain (`info.marome-investments.co.za`), where the backend API is properly connected.
